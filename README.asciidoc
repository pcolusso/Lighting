Info
----

This is a small project attempting to implement OrangyTang's
dynamic shadow algorithm in C# w/ OpenTK. Hopefully, we should 
be able to move towarards a shader-based one instead.

Todo
----
.Planned Activity
- [[Finish OrangyTang Implementation]] Complete the OrangyTang implementation
- [[Remove Immediate Mode]] Try to implement more efficient means of rendering, like VBOs
- [[Implement Shaders]] Try to alleviate CPU load
- [[Implement CatlinZima Shadows]] Port the XNA shader-based shadow generator to OGL
